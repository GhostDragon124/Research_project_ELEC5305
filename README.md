Music Genre Classification with Deep Learning Methods

Data

For a project, I compared four methods to classify music genres from the GTZAN dataset. The main purpose of this project is to develop an efficient deep-learning music genre classification system to classify music genres and try to achieve the highest accuracy.

How to run this code?

To run this code, you just need to upload Jupiter Notebook to the Google Colab and upload the "Kaggle.jason" file. Then, click the run button. The first run will create a Kaggle folder in the Colab root directory, and the program will say that it cannot find the "Kaggle.jason" file. Then Just click the run button again, and the program can properly download the dataset and start to train all methods one by one.
